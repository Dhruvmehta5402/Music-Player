Music Player to autoplay music offline on computer/pen drive

I was playing some music that I had on my Pen Drive on my laptop  
and for some reason, the default music player for Windows (Groove Music) did not have an autoplay option  
and every time a song ended I had to go back to the folder to play the next song.  
To avoid this, I wrote this python script using the playsound module to play songs from my song folder.  
I even added a shuffle feature and incorporated text to speech to speak the song name before the song is played.
